#Basic Setup for a front-end engineer.
This is a clean basic setup to do your front-end mojo using all the cool tools. Gulp, Webpack (yes they play well together),SASS, Bootstrap, and React. Made this mainly for myself but I thought it might be a useful starting point for others.

Look, learn, play.
